    <h2 id="honorable-reader">Honorable reader,</h2>
<p>Thanks for tuning in to todays show. We are continuing our discussion of the  <strong>fundamental theorem on symmetric polynomials</strong>. Do have a look at last weeks show, in case you missed it.</p>

<p>There is no time for small talk, we have some work to do.</p>

<h2 id="lets-refresh-our-memory">Let’s refresh our memory</h2>

<p>In case you forgot, the theorem we are working on is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fundamental theorem on symmetric polynomials</strong> 
There exists an algorithm that rewrites any symmetric polynomial in $n$ variables $x_1,…,x_n$ as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, the symmetric polynomial $a^2+b^2$ in 2 variables can be rewritten as $\sigma_1^2-2\sigma_2$, where $\sigma_1 = a+b,\sigma_2 = ab$ are the elementary symmetric polynomials in 2 variables.</p>

<p>Last week, we detailed an algorithm to transform symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables into polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables, illustrating it with a concrete example. Let’s revisit this algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="the-algorithm">The algorithm</h2>

<p>Let $f(x_1,…,x_n)$ be a symmetric polynomial in $n$ variables. We will describe a procedure by which you can rewrite $f$ as a polynomial $g(\sigma_1,…,\sigma_n)$ in the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables.</p>

<p>As we go along, we will be using the following example polynomial: $f(a,b,c) = a^3bc+b^3ac+c^3ab$.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Base case</strong>. If the number of variables in our polynomial is 1, then return the polynomial as it is. Otherwise, continue with step 2.</li>
  <li><strong>Variable selection and rearrangement</strong>. Pick a variable of your choice, like $c$ and rearrange your expression as a polynomial in this variable. We write $(a^3b+b^3a)c+(ab)c^3$</li>
  <li><strong>Recursive rewriting</strong>. Recursively rewrite each of the coefficients, which are now symmetric polynomials in 2 variables, as polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials in 2 variables. In terms of our example, you get an expression of the form:<br />
$Q_1(\tau_1,\tau_2)c+Q_2(\tau_1,\tau_2)c^3$, where $Q_i(\tau_1,\tau_2)$ are the coefficients rewritten in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials in 2 variables.</li>
  <li><strong>Substitution and rearrangement</strong>. Observe that the recursive definition of elementary symmetric polynomials allows us to obtain the following relations:<br />
\(\begin{align}\tau_1&amp; = \sigma_1-c\\
\tau_2 &amp;= \sigma_2 - c\tau_1 = \sigma_2-\sigma_1c+c^2
\\
0 &amp;=\sigma_3-c\tau_{2}=\sigma_3-c\sigma_{2}+c^2\sigma_{1}-c^3\end{align}\)<br />
Using the first two relations, substitute $\tau_1$ for $\sigma_1-c$ and $\tau_2$ for $\sigma_2-\sigma_1c+c^2$ in both $Q_1,Q_2$. Rearrange the expression as a polynomial in $c$.</li>
  <li><strong>Division and remainder</strong>. Divide your resultant polynomial by the polynomial in the righthandside of relation (3) from the previous step, and return the remainder of this operation.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="correctness-of-the-algorithm">Correctness of the algorithm</h2>

<p>The instructions of the algorithm are straightforward (albeit tedious to follow). If we assume the algorithm to work correctly for symmetric polynomials for $n-1$ variables, it is easy to believe that following the algorithm we can convert a symmetric polynomial $f(x_1,…,x_n)$ with rational coefficients into a polynomial $p(x_n)$ with coefficients that themselves are polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables. It is also straightforward to see, from this construction, that the polynomial $p(x_n)$, being the remainder of a division by a polynomial of degree $n$ (see step 5 of algorithm), is of degree at most $n-1$. It is <strong>not clear</strong> that it is necessarily a constant polynomial, thereby simply some expression in the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables. <br />
The magic of the algorithm lies in understanding why this follows. Once we understand this connection, a proof by induction spells itself out naturally.</p>

<p>The critical observation one must make is that the algorithm allows for one degree of freedom: In step 2, we are asked to pick a variable of our choice, and to rearrange our given symmetric polynomial as a polynomial in this variable. In the example we gave, we rearranged $a^3bc+b^3ac+c^3ab$ as $(a^3b+b^3a)c+(ab)c^3$, as a polynomial in $c$ with coefficients being symmetric polynomials in $a,b$. However, we could have just as easily rearranged it to read $(a^3c+c^3a)b+(ac)b^3$ or $(b^3c+c^3b)a+(bc)a^3$. This means, that we could have continued the other steps making a different choice, other than $c$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> how does the choice of variable in step 2 affect the rest of the algorithm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s right, it doesn’t! <strong>Any choice</strong> we could have made would lead to an identical result. Let’s make this more concrete. If we start with $f(x_1,…,x_n)$, in step 2 we choose $x_n$, then we end up with a polynomial $p_1(x_n)$ in $x_n$ with coefficients that are polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials. If instead we had chosen $x_1$, we would have ended up with a polynomial $p_2(x_1)$ in $x_1$ with coefficients that are polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials. However, it turns out that $p_1 = p_2$, the underlying polynomial we end up with does not depend on whether we proceed with $x_1$ or $x_n$, as a result of the symmetry of the polynomial $f(x_1,…,x_n)$ we started out with.
This implies that any initial choice of variable $x_1,…,x_n$ ends up as a root of the polynomial $g(Y) = p(Y)-f(x_1,…,x_n)$ . 
If $g(Y)$ is non-zero, and $x_1,..,x_n$ are all roots, this implies that $(Y-x_1),…,(Y-x_n)$ are all divisors of this polynomial. Ultimately, it follows that $g(Y)$ has degree at least $n$, which is a contradiction. Thus it must be the zero polynomial. This implies that all coefficients of $g(Y)$ are zero, which completes the proof.</p>
<h2 id="more-generally">More generally…</h2>
<p>The punchline of the correctness proof above underlies a simple setup. We constructed a polynomial with “symmetric coefficients” (the coefficients being symmetric polynomials in $x_1,…,x_n$), that has $x_k$ as a root for some $k \le n$. Whenever we have such a situation, we can immediately infer that the constructed polynomial has degree at least $n$ if it isn’t the zero polynomial (<strong>why?</strong>).</p>

<p>There is a natural way to generalise this setup and peek into some of the ideas underlying Galois theory. Suppose you have some polynomial $f(Y)$ with symmetric coefficients. Now, suppose it has $r(x_1,…,x_n)$ as a root, where $r$ is some polynomial (not necessarily symmetric). In other words:</p>

\[\begin{align}s_mr^m+...+s_0 = 0\end{align}\]

<p>Then any permutation of the $n$ variables keeps the coefficients of the above polynomial constant, but possibly changes $r$ into another root of the same polynomial.<br />
Now if we call $r_1,…,r_k$ all the distinct polynomials we can obtain by applying any permutation to $r$, we know that $r_1,…,r_k$ must all be roots of the polynomial</p>

\[\begin{align}s_mY^m+...+s_0 = 0\end{align}\]

<p>Then, by the same logic as before, this implies that $m \ge k$. <br />
In some sense we can think of the number $k$ as a measure of how “asymmetric” the root $r$ is. In the case $r = x_n$, we have $k = n$. Once we start thinking of symmetry as a spectrum, not a binary state, we make a productive leap that launches us into Galois theory.</p>

<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>

<p>This concludes our exploration of the fundamental theorem on symmetric polynomials. The process of writing this has spurred on some important questions on how I should go about writing articles in this blog. The level of rigour I chose in this article was low, which could make for a more pleasant read, but can also come across as confusing. I am also quite uncertain what audience I want to be writing for. Whilst the last two articles are rather beginner-friendly, some foundation in algebraic thinking might be necessary for the material to make sense. I will aim to address some of these questions in the future.</p>

<h2 id="references--literature--further-reading">References / Literature / Further reading</h2>

<p>I am working with the book “Galois theory” by Harold M. Edwards. Pages 8-13 contain the fundamental theorem on symmetric polynomials. My interpretation follows the text closely.</p>
